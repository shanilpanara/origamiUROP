# Easy Route

## Summary

In this protocol, we create a simple path using the `lattice.LatticeRoute` class.

To start we create a long piece of single-stranded DNA using `oxdna.Strand` and compare it to `lattice.LatticeRoute` made using 3 nodes. This demonstrates that the `lattice.LatticeRoute` class creates reasonable structures.

We then move on to manually create more routes and demonstrate different output file formats.

## Usage

```pip install ../.. && python main.py```
