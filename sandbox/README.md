# Sandbox

The sandbox exists to experiment with code, in particular standalone scripts

## Usage

When adding a script to the sandbox, try and do the following:

- Add a docstring to the top of the file (using triple quotes)
- if the script will be callable from the command-line (which it probably will be) put an if __name__ == '__main__': statement at the end of the script
- Add a summary of the script, including filename and brief description below

## Scripts

- `empty.py` - contains nothing, acts as a template/placeholder
- `file2vertices.py` - contains an algorithm to extract vertices from different file types and make them cyclical, currently does not work
